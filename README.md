## Repository Overview

This repository contains multiple projects including a quantitative trading system and AI engineering resources.

## AI Development Guidelines

All AI-assisted development in this repository must follow the structured Task Workflow documented in:

📚 **[AI Rules and Guidelines](docs/AI_RULES_EN.md)**

The workflow consists of 6 mandatory phases:
1. **Questions** - Requirements gathering
2. **Design** - Solution planning
3. **Models** - Data structure definition
4. **Tests** - Test creation (TDD)
5. **Implementation** - Code changes
6. **Verification** - Testing and validation

For detailed guidance on each phase, see the [Execution Library](docs/ai/en/README.md).
